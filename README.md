## Introduction

This is a Linux kernel module (LKM) designed to work with Intel PCIe Ethernet devices. The driver loads, probes, and removes a specific Intel PCIe device, providing basic device initialization and logging the device information to the kernel logs.

## Features

- Supports **Intel 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller**.
- Simple **PCI device initialization** and logging.
- **Kernel module** (LKM) based, easy to load and unload.
- Logs detected device information including vendor and device IDs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have the required development tools and kernel headers installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
